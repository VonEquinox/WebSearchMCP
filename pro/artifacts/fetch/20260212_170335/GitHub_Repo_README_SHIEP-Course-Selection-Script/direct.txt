README
Course Selection Engine
An asynchronous automation tool for course registration, inquiry, and session management. This engine is designed to handle state-heavy legacy systems by simulating required navigation paths and maintaining persistent session states.
Technical Context
The system requires specific session activation sequences to prevent server-side errors. For a detailed technical analysis of the underlying access logic, refer to:
about_access_permissions.md
.
Installation
This project requires Python 3.10+ and uses
uv
for dependency management.
Install the environment and dependencies:
uv sync
Configuration Guide
Configuration is managed via
custom.py
. Copy the template to begin:
cp custom.py.example custom.py
1. Account Cookies
Required for all operations.
How to obtain
: Open the course system in a browser, press
F12
, and navigate to
Application
->
Storage
->
Cookies
.
Values
: Copy the values for
JSESSIONID
and
SERVERNAME
.
Expiry
: If the script returns
302
redirects, your cookies have expired and must be updated in
custom.py
.
2. Identifying the Profile ID
The
profileId
is a prerequisite for both inquiry and selection.
How to obtain
: Log in to the course system manually and enter the course selection module. Check the browser address bar for the URL; the
profileId
is the numeric value following the
profileId=
parameter.
Usage
: Enter this ID in
INQUIRY_USER_DATA
to enable searching, and in
USER_CONFIGS
for registration.
3. Fetching Course Information
With valid cookies and a
profileId
, use the inquiry tool to retrieve specific course details.
Command
:
uv run main.py --inquire
Function
: This command retrieves course names, teacher information, current enrollment status, and the unique
Course ID
.
Alternative
: Course IDs can also be obtained by inspecting network traffic via browser developer tools (
F12
), though using the
--inquire
function is recommended for efficiency.
Usage
: Copy the
Course ID
from the inquiry results into the
course_ids
list under
USER_CONFIGS
for the registration process.
4. Proxy and Network Environments
Configuration of the
USE_PROXY
setting depends on your connection method:
Official VPN (EasyConnect) or Campus Network
: These environments usually provide a direct route to the server, requiring
USE_PROXY
to be set to
False
.
Third-party VPNs (e.g., EasierConnect)
: These environments often require a SOCKS5 proxy to route traffic. Set
USE_PROXY
to
True
and specify the proxy server address and port within the
proxies
dictionary in
custom.py
.
5. API Parameters
Configure
ENROLLMENT_DATA_API_PARAMS
with the correct
projectId
and
semesterId
.
How to obtain
: Open the browser developer tools (
F12
), switch to the
Network
tab, and refresh the course system page. Search for
projectId
or
semesterId
within the captured requests to find the values for the current academic term.
Usage
Commands are executed via
uv run main.py <command>
.
Available Commands
--start
: Executes the registration process for all users defined in
USER_CONFIGS
.
--endless
: Optional flag to retry indefinitely until successful. Used for sniping courses as they become available.
--inquire
: Interactive mode to search for courses and check enrollment status. Requires a valid
profileId
.
--validate
: Batch verification of cookie validity for all accounts.
--check
: Real-time verification of course capacity and current enrollment status for courses in your config.
--help
: Displays the command help menu.
Characteristics
Asynchronous Concurrency
: Built with
asyncio
and
aiohttp
for efficient multi-account management.
Session Activation
: Automated pre-access routine to satisfy server-side state requirements.
Rate Limit Protection
: Implements sequential activation and task interleaving to avoid triggering IP or session-based frequency limits.
Data Sanitization
: Built-in recovery for non-standard JSON responses from legacy endpoints.
Maintenance and Safety
SSL
: Verification is disabled by default to accommodate internal network certificate issues.
Termination
: Use
Ctrl+C
to stop the process safely.
